For original project access go into windows powershell <br>
> **Step 1)** make a project directory (I used `md project_website_username`) <br>
> **Step 2)** Change into your directory (`cd project_website_username`) <br>
> **Step 3)** make a notepad python file (`notepad app.py`) <br>
> **Step 4)** You can paste the code in the other "original website code" file or import it through github but might require extra steps <br>
> **Step 5)** make sure python is installed (python --version) if not installed, install it using winget or other tools(`winget install python.python.3.12`). <br>
> **Step 6)** Make sure Flask is installed (`pip install flask` might work but if not `python -m pip install flask` should work, if it does not, make sure you have python installed. <br>
> **Step 7)** after you have made sure your code is in the python notepad and flask is installed you should be able to run using (`python app.py`) <br>
> **Step 8)** runnning this in wondows powershell will not open the website it will give you the port to the http. of the website and ip and you will have to copy and paste into the browser <br>

All steps for the previous project are complete with the next project we can talk about access or just changes but if our method of access changes it would be good to post here.
